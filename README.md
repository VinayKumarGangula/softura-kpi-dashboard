## 🧠 Project Overview

As a Data Analyst at Softura Solutions, I built an integrated analytics solution to provide real-time visibility into supply chain operations. The goal was to enhance business decision-making by enabling on-demand access to performance metrics through dashboards in Power BI, Tableau, and Looker Studio.

Using cloud-based tools like Google BigQuery and Composer, I automated data pipelines that processed 10M+ event logs, enabling teams to monitor trends in inventory turnover, delivery performance, and customer churn.
